## General Info

This project is the first part of worksheet two, part of the module named IOT. The primary goal is to convert messages (inputs) to encoded and decoded texts.

## Technologies Used

Python 3.8.10 and Visual Studio Code version 1.65.2 were used in this project.

## Features

Various tests are included in this project for testing the correctness of the code. The main feature of the project is the converter, which can convert strings to Morse code and vice versa.

## Usage

You have several options to test and use it:

1. Converting your own words in "main.py". This takes your input and converts it to Morse code or decodes it.
2. Use the predefined test named "Eleven know it's Hooper" in "main.py".
3. Explore other tests, such as assert tests in "assert_test.py" and unittest in "morseunit.py".

## Testing

The project includes different tests to ensure code correctness. Feel free to explore and run these tests.
